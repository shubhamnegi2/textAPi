So many children are naturally drawn to puppets and puppet shows. This lesson gives you some great ideas for short stories that are conducive to puppet work and play with your children.
The Beauty of the Puppet
Whether you are trying to help your students develop into more fluent readers, appreciate the imaginative quality of storytelling more deeply, or grow their awareness of character complexity, working with puppets can be a marvelous idea. When kids use puppets to enact stories, they put their artistic acumen to work and engage in deep comprehension thinking as well!

Some stories are more conducive to puppet work than others, however. A good puppet story is one with multiple strong characters with clear personality traits and a simple yet intriguing plot. A puppet story does not have too many set changes and can be told fairly well through dialogue. The stories in this lesson are chosen for their appeal to young readers as well as their potential to make great puppet shows.

Puppet Stories
This section offers a list of short stories along with summaries and ideas about why they work well with puppets.

A Place to Call Home by Alexis Deacon and Viviane Schwarz
In A Place to Call Home, a family of hamsters leaves a cozy nest to go out into the world. They prepare themselves thoughtfully so that they will stay safe, but they get into a few scrapes on their journey. The story has strong, memorable characters. Obvious props also help it lend itself to performance art. Students will have plenty of opportunities to laugh as they work with this story and make hamster puppets of their own.

Sylvester and the Magic Pebble by William Steig
Sylvester is a donkey who has so many different wishes, and one day, he accidentally wishes himself into a rock! His family is devastated that Sylvester is missing, and they work hard to get him back. The story has a happy ending and teaches a wonderful moral about the importance of love and family. Steig's narration can be easily converted into dialogue, and the relatively simple animal characters will translate into puppets kids are sure to love.

There is a Bird on Your Head by Mo Willems
Willems' Gerald and Piggie books are eminently popular with young readers, in part because they are told exclusively in dialogue between two beloved friends. This is also what makes them particularly well suited to puppetry! In this story, a bird lands on Gerald's head, and Piggie has to help his friend figure out what to do about it. The hilarity in the story's surprise ending, as well as the theme of abiding friendship, will make the puppet show especially splendid.
